This folder contains all the notebooks we used to conduct our experiments. Their specifications are listed below :
- `dropout_test.ipynb` : This notebook presents the comparison between networks trained with classical stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and containing dropout units, versus networks trained with Delay compensation asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (DC-ASGD).
- `regression.ipynb` : This notebook presents the comparison between SGD and DCASG for a task of linear regression.
- `image_classification.ipynb` : This notebook presents the comparison between SGD and DCASG for a task of linear regression.
- `regression.ipynb` : This notebook aims to compare SGD and DSCAGD on a simple task of linear regression.
- `nlp.ipynb` : This notebook aims to compare SGD and DSCAGD on a text classification task (Natural Language processing)
